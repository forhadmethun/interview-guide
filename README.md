  - What are important Java EE Design Patterns? https://github.com/in28minutes/Java-EE-Design-Patterns
##### Creational patterns (Object Creation)
  - Factory method
    - create family of object types
    - hides complexity of class definition for user
      - java.util.Calendar#getInstance() & java.nio.charset.Charset#forName()
  - Prototype
    - Without creating the object again and again we copy from already created object 
      - java.lang.Object#clone()
  - Singleton
    - most famous
    - only one instance per JVM 
    - constructor should be private
    - best way to create is using enum
    - difficult to unit test
    - java.lang.Runtime#getRuntime() & java.lang.System#getSecurityManager()
  - Builder
    - Separate object creation from its representation
    - We can want to get an object with different ingredients, sometimes with one, sometimes with multiple etc.
    
##### Some Structural patterns (How structure is, if extends another)
  - Adapter
    - match interfaces of different classes 
      - java.util.Arrays#asList() & javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter#marshal() and #unmarshal()
         - sending json to webservice from java server is kind of adapter
     
  - Decorator
    - Add responsibility to objects dynamically
      - Adding behavior dynamically 

    - All subclasses of java.io.InputStream, OutputStream etc. & java.util.Collections : synchronizedXXX() and unmodifiableXXX() methods.
  - Flyweight
    - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing 
    - java.lang.Integer#valueOf(int) (also on other Wrapper classes)
        - public sharing switched telephone network 
        - jdbc connection     
  - Proxy
    - an object representing another object
      - debit card is a proxy for what is in our bank account 
    - hides complexity of real object 
  - Facade
    - single class which represents an entire subsystem  
      - ex: event manager, online book order
    - reduce network calls
    - reduce coupling 
    - transactional boundary 
    
  
##### Behavioral patterns (How one object communicate with another)
  - Chain of responsibility
    - passing request a chain of objects
      - exception handling, check sequentially to parent objects if there are any exception handling 
      
      - loans approval for clerk, their manager then their manager 
      - javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter() & Exception Handling
  - Command
    - java.lang.Runnable
  - Iterator
    - All implementations of java.util.Iterator
    - Sequential  ly access all objects 
      - example: remote next/prev button
  - State
    - Alter object's behavior when its state changes
      - example: fan control in wall
  - Strategy (recognizeable by behavioral methods in an abstract/interface type which invokes a method in an implementation of a different abstract/interface type which has been passed-in as method argument into the strategy implementation)
    - java.util.Comparator#compare(), executed by among others Collections#sort().
    - incapsulates an algorithm inside a class
      - example: using comparable implementation as parameter to choose which to use
  - Observer Pattern 
    - A way of notifying cnge to number of classes
      - example: notify all the better, notify user that cricketer scored century.
      
  - Visitor Pattern
    - Defines a new operation to a class without change
      - example: we can extend/use functionality of a framework but cannot change it, when visitor get into a cab then only the driver has the control not the cab visitor. 
   
  - Template method (recognizeable by behavioral methods which already have a "default" behaviour definied by an abstract type)
    - High level details is given and low level details need to be implemented.
    - All non-abstract methods of java.util.AbstractList, java.util.AbstractSet and java.util.AbstractMap.
      - example: floor plan, the foundation, framing, plumbing, wiring wall be identical for each houses so basic template is helpful. Variation can be added later.
  - Command Pattern
    - Example: Waiter take command pass to Chef then to Waiter then served, request object, Runnable class 
  - Memento Pattern
    - Capture and restore an object's internal state
    - Example: Saving and restoring state at a certain position in game, Serializer in Java, undo & redo operation.
  - Mediator Pattern
    - Simplified communication between classes
    - Example: Air traffic controller, ESB( application communicate )
